# Technical & Strategic Audit - "Sóc de Poble" Project

Hello! I need you to perform an in-depth and critical audit of my current project: **Sóc de Poble**, a proximity-based social network designed to revitalize local communities. I'm in talks with a strategic technology partner (Sollutia) and I want to ensure the system is robust, scalable, and professional.

---

## 1. Project Context

**Mission:** Connect neighbors through a Wall (Feed), a proximity Marketplace, local action Groups, and an Events system.

**Differentiator:** 'Multi-Identity' system (ability to post as a person, business, or official entity) and a 'Playground' mode with NPC simulation via AI to boost community engagement from the beta phase.

---

## 2. Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js (Vite) with Vanilla CSS (modern design variables, Dribbble-inspired).
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Real-time).
- **Security:** Row Level Security (RLS) implemented in database and Storage.
- **Architecture:** Context decomposition (UI, Auth, I18n) to optimize performance.

---

## 3. Internal Audit Status (already completed)

- ✅ Completed migration to UUIDs for all tables.
- ✅ Eliminated all `console.logs` technical debt and standardized a professional `logger`.
- ✅ Passed WCAG accessibility filter (labels, aria-labels, semantic HTML5).
- ✅ Implemented a global creation system (centralized modals) with event-based data refresh.

## 4. What I need from you?

Analyze the information I'll provide and give me your feedback on:

### 🔐 Security
Review whether the Supabase access pattern from the client is secure or if you detect potential data leaks.

### 📈 Scalability
Is the current context architecture capable of handling thousands of active users?

### 🎨 UX/UI
Review the consistency of the global publication flow.

### ⚠️ Failure Points
Tell me **"what will break first"** when the project grows.

## 📎 Attached Files for Review

1. **Soc_de_Poble_Dossier.md** - Business context and strategic roadmap
2. **supabaseService.js** - Service layer and data logic
3. **index.css** - Design system and accessibility
4. **AuthContext.jsx** - Session management and authentication
5. **Feed.jsx** - Main Wall component (UX example)

Be prepared to review the code I'll send you next. **Be critical and direct**. I'd rather know the problems now than discover them in production.
